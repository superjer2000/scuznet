	 * 1) Writing to the memory card,
	 * 2) Reading from the memory card.

	 * for the single-shot type of transfers that the USARTs generate.
	 * 
	 * Before using, these must have:
	 * 
	 * 1) Source address set (for write channels)
	 * 2) Source increment set or cleared (for write channels)
	 * 3) Destination address set (for read channels)
	 * 4) Destination increment set or cleared (for read channels)
	 * 5) Transfer length set to the number of bytes to run via DMA.
	 * 6) Interrupts activated or deactivated.

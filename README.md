<<< THIS IS A FORKED VERSION OF SCUZNET SUPPORTING DAYNALINK EMULATION >>>
<<< SEE SCUZNET-DAYNAPORT README >>>

Open source hardware emulating a Nuvolink SCSI to Ethernet adapter, for use
with vintage Macintosh computers.

# Status

The firmware is at an early alpha stage. There are many things that are known
to not work correctly, and there are likely a large number of other bugs that
have yet to be identified and/or fixed.

If you encounter problems, please open a new issue.

# Compatibility

This implementation has some limitations by design:

1. There must be only one initiator on the bus.
2. The initiator on the bus must be at ID 7.
3. Read parity is not used. Transmission parity is provided but may be disabled
   to improve performance.

These should not be a significant problem for the target computer platform,
which for the most part has similar limitations.

# Device Configuration

The supplied memory card should be FAT32 formatted (exFAT is not currently
supported). On boot the firmware will look for `scuznet.ini` on the card to
configure itself. See the example file in the repository for more information.

When compiling, verify that -DHW_VXXX in the Makefile is replaced with the
appropriate hardware revision.

The virtual hard drive can be formatted within class Mac OS using a variety of
era-appropriate SCSI tools. Patched versions of *HD SC Setup* are known to
work correctly.
